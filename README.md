# The open_FRED command line interface

Is a script collecting useful commands to work with databases containing
*open_FRED* data.

# Installation

Until this is converted to a proper Python package, you have to install the
script's dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Run this command
in the root directory of the source code repository. It's probably best to
Install the dependencies into a [virtual environment][0]. Once you've done
this, make yourself familiar with the program by running:

```
python openFRED.py --help
```

from the repository root and explore from there.
